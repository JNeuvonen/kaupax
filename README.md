# What is it?

Kaupax is a platform that allows individuals who want to sell their apartment to conveniently compare service fees from local real estate agents.

# More detailed

The user has the ability to list their apartment, specifying key details such as the street address, city, and surface area.Realtors can then make bids, detailing their service fees.The user also has access to information about each realtor,such as their experience and track record.

Currently, the code is at the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage. The primary aim is not to create a fully functional product at this stage but to serve as material for potential employees to evaluate.

Both clients and realtors have their own front ends.

The backend is written in Node, and the demo site that is online uses AWS RDS Postgresql DB. Both front-ends are written using Next and MUI.
